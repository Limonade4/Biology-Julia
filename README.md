# Welcome to my Julia Biology repository !

Here you can find all my *Pluto notebooks* (written in Julia). 

Most projects are for **teaching** purpose but some are just fun simulations and stuff I did during my free time.

Notebooks that are not used for a specific course are gathered in the `Miscellaneous` folder.
