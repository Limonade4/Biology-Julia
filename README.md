# Welcome to my Julia Biology repository ! 

Here you can find all my *Pluto notebooks* (written in Julia).

## Interactive access via binder

***To have an immediate and interactive access to the notebooks follow 'this link'*** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Limonade4/Biology-Julia/HEAD?urlpath=pluto%2Fopen%3Fpath%3DSummary.jl)

Most projects are for **teaching** purpose but some are just fun simulations and stuff I did during my free time.

Notebooks that are **not** used for a specific course are gathered in the `Miscellaneous` folder.
